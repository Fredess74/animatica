## Activity Summary (2026-02-27)
- **Commits Today:** 0
- **Files Changed:** 0
- **Key Accomplishments:**
  - Audited full documentation suite.
  - Verified Phase 1 Engine Core completion.
  - Identified critical blockers in CI/CD pipeline (Lint & Typecheck).

## Blockers & Challenges
1. **Engine Test Regressions:** `CharacterRenderer` tests are broken due to internal component structure changes.
2. **Editor Type Errors:** `@Animatica/editor` cannot resolve `@animatica/engine` types, likely due to missing build artifacts or incorrect linking.
3. **Linting Failure:** ESLint v9 transition is incomplete; `eslint.config.js` is missing across the monorepo.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1. **Fix CharacterRenderer Tests:** Update the test strategy to correctly access the component's render function or use a more robust mocking approach.
2. **Build Engine Package:** Run `pnpm build --filter @Animatica/engine` to ensure type declarations are available for the editor.
3. **ESLint Migration:** Create `eslint.config.js` in the root and packages to restore linting capabilities.
4. **Phase 2 Progress:** Kick off `HumanoidRenderer` and `BoneController` development.
