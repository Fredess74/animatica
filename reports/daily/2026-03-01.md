# Nightly Status Report — 2026-03-01

## 📊 Project Health: 8/10

The project is in a stable state with core engine features fully tested and functional. Recent efforts have successfully resolved a major regression in `CharacterRenderer` and improved the reliability of the test suite. The editor package still has some TypeScript build errors that need attention, but runtime functionality remains largely intact.

## 🛠️ Nightly Activity

### Commits Today
- `051808e` fix: resolve 30+ TS errors — PlaybackState fields, duplicate imports, import paths, type mismatches

### Files Changed
- `docs/AGENT_TASKS.md`
- `packages/engine/src/scene/renderers/CharacterRenderer.tsx`
- `packages/engine/src/scene/renderers/CharacterRenderer.test.tsx`
- `packages/engine/vite.config.ts`
- `packages/editor/src/viewport/Viewport.tsx`
- `packages/editor/src/viewport/Viewport.test.tsx`

---

## ✨ Key Accomplishments
- **Fixed `CharacterRenderer`:** Resolved a critical `TypeError` that was breaking the rendering of character actors and failing tests.
- **Improved Testing Environment:** Updated `vite.config.ts` to support JSDOM and increased test timeouts to accommodate long-running benchmarks.
- **Consolidated `Viewport`:** Switched the editor `Viewport` to use the unified `SceneManager` from the engine, reducing code duplication.
- **Agent Task Cleanup:** Removed merge conflict markers from `AGENT_TASKS.md` that were blocking automated workflows.
- **Cross-Package Fixes:** Resolved import case-sensitivity issues (`@Animatica` vs `@animatica`) that were causing build failures in the editor package.

---

## 🚧 Blockers Found
- **Editor TS Errors:** The `@Animatica/editor` package currently fails the TypeScript build (`tsc -b`) due to unused variables and missing `args` properties in some R3F components. This does not block testing but prevents production builds.

---

## 💡 Recommendations for Tomorrow
1. **Clean up Editor TS Errors:** Address the remaining `unused variable` and `missing property` errors in `packages/editor/src/viewport/` to enable a clean build.
2. **Continue Character System:** Proceed with `BoneController` and `MorphTargets` implementation as planned in Phase 2.
3. **Finish Zod Refactor:** Complete Task 2 by ensuring all Zod schema imports are pointing to the new `importer/schemas` directory.
