- **Key Commit:** `65fe020` - "feat: add 3D viewport (10 files) and character system (7 files) with PBR skin, 52 morph targets, animation state machine, 10 presets"

## Key Accomplishments
- **Large Scale Feature Addition:** Attempted to add the 3D viewport, character system, and various editor components in a single operation.
- **Test Suite Expansion:** Significant increase in test coverage (total tests increased from 129 to 266).

## Blockers Found
- **Massive Breaking Commit:** Commit `65fe020` changed 185 files, violating the "Max 5 files per PR" rule in `JULES_GUIDE.md`. This has caused significant instability.
- **TypeScript Build Failures:** `@Animatica/engine` fails to build with errors regarding missing properties in `PlaybackState`, missing modules in `CharacterRenderer`, and duplicate identifiers in `sceneStore.ts`.
- **Merge Conflicts in Docs:** `docs/AGENT_TASKS.md` contains unhandled git merge markers, indicating coordination failures.
- **Forbidden Content:** The `packages/contracts` and `docs/SMART_CONTRACTS.md` files still exist, violating the strict prohibition against blockchain/crypto content.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1. **Emergency Build Repair:** Immediately address the TypeScript errors in `@Animatica/engine`.
2. **Enforce PR Size Limits:** Strictly adhere to the 5-file limit per PR to prevent future "big bang" failures.
3. **Cleanup Forbidden Content:** Delete `packages/contracts` and `docs/SMART_CONTRACTS.md` as they are explicitly out-of-scope.
4. **Repair Documentation:** Resolve the merge conflicts in `docs/AGENT_TASKS.md` and sync `BACKLOG.md` with the actual codebase status.
5. **Stabilize Tests:** Fix the 24 failing tests once the build is restored.
