# Nightly Status Report: 2026-02-23

## Project Health Score: 8/10
The project has made massive progress today with the integration of the Editor UI and the remaining Engine Core components. All 129 tests are passing. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the `BACKLOG.md` tracking and the actual codebase, and the Zod schemas refactor (Task 2) is still pending.

## Tests
- **Passed:** 129
- **Failed:** 0
- **Total:** 129

## Issues
- **Open:** 9 (Tasks 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)
- **Closed:** 6 (Tasks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 21)
- *Note:* Tasks 7, 8, 9, and 10 appear to be implemented in the codebase but are still marked as "Backlog" in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## Commits Today
- **e0fa290** `perf(engine): optimize three.js imports`
- **89a5dc5** `docs(license-auditor): verify dependency license compatibility`
- **60c1cb5** `Merge pull request #81 from Fredess74/fix/type-auditor-engine-7540319469481237432` (Includes bulk of Editor UI and Rendering components)

## Files Changed
- **Total Files:** 131
- **Key Changes:**
    - Integrated Editor UI panels: `AssetLibrary`, `PropertiesPanel`, `TimelinePanel`, `ScriptConsole`, and `ExportModal`.
    - Implemented core rendering components: `LightRenderer`, `CameraRenderer`, and `SceneManager`.
    - Implemented `PlaybackController` for animation timing.
    - Set up `i18n` and keyboard shortcuts for the editor.
    - Added comprehensive tests for new components.
    - Optimized Three.js imports to improve bundle size.
    - Conducted a license compatibility audit for dependencies.

## Key Accomplishments
1.  **Rendering Pipeline Completion:** Successfully implemented and tested the `SceneManager`, `LightRenderer`, and `CameraRenderer`, completing the Batch 2 requirements.
2.  **Editor UI Integration:** Delivered a fully functional editor layout with all planned panels (Asset, Properties, Timeline) and modals (Script, Export), satisfying Batch 4.
3.  **High Test Coverage:** Maintained 100% pass rate with 129 unit and integration tests across the monorepo.
4.  **Infrastructure Polish:** Optimized imports and verified license compliance, ensuring project sustainability.

## Blockers Found
1.  **Documentation Desync:** `docs/BACKLOG.md` and `docs/PROGRESS.md` do not accurately reflect the current state of implementation for Tasks 7-10 and 15-20.
2.  **Schema Refactor Pending:** Task 2 (moving Zod schemas to `src/importer/schemas/`) remains incomplete, causing a slight deviation from the `JULES_GUIDE.md` structure.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1.  **Synchronize Backlog:** Update `docs/BACKLOG.md` and `docs/PROGRESS.md` to mark Tasks 7-10 and 15-20 as completed.
2.  **Execute Task 2 Refactor:** Move Zod schemas to the correct directory and update all import references.
3.  **Initiate Batch 3 (Characters):** Begin work on the Humanoid base component and bone controller.
