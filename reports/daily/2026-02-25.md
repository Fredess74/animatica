- **Total Tests:** 129

## Issue Tracking
- **Open Issues:** 9
- **Closed Issues Today:** 0
- **Total Closed Issues:** 6 (as tracked in BACKLOG.md)

## Activity Summary (Today)
- **Commits Today:** 0
- **Files Changed Today:** 0

## Key Accomplishments
- **Full Build & Test Pass:** Verified that the entire monorepo builds successfully and all 129 tests pass.
- **Renderer Verification:** Confirmed that `LightRenderer`, `CameraRenderer`, and `SceneManager` are implemented in `packages/engine`.
- **Environment Stability:** Re-stabilized the development environment with `pnpm install` and root build.

## Blockers Found
- **Documentation Drift:** `BACKLOG.md` is out of sync with the actual state of the codebase. It still lists Phase 1 tasks (7-10) as open, whereas `PROGRESS.md` and the filesystem show them as completed. This may confuse automated agents or new contributors.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1. **Sync Documentation:** Update `BACKLOG.md` to move Tasks 7, 8, 9, and 10 to the "Done" section.
2. **Execute Task 2:** Begin the high-priority refactor of moving Zod schemas to `packages/engine/src/importer/schemas/`.
3. **Initialize Phase 2:** Start work on Task 11 (`Humanoid` base component).
4. **Update Metrics:** Refresh `docs/METRICS.md` with the latest LOC and test counts.
