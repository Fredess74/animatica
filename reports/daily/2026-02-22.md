# Nightly Status Report: 2026-02-22

## Project Health Score: 9/10
The project is off to a strong start. Comprehensive documentation and automation systems are in place. Core engine components (schemas, types, interpolation) are implemented with 100% test pass rate.

## Tests
- **Passed:** 73
- **Failed:** 0
- **Total:** 73

## Issues
- Access to live GitHub issues is restricted in this environment. No local issue tracking file found.
- Recommendation: Use `docs/ROADMAP.md` or a local `ISSUES.md` to track progress if live GitHub access remains unavailable.

## Commits Today
- **6716f33** `docs: add AUTOMATION_PLAYBOOK with 40 daily agent system` (Fredess74)

## Files Changed
- **Total Files:** 61
- **Key Changes:**
    - Initialized project documentation structure (`docs/`).
    - Added `AUTOMATION_PLAYBOOK.md` defining the 40-agent system.
    - Implemented core engine components:
        - Schemas (`src/schemas/`)
        - Types (`src/types/`)
        - Interpolation Logic (`src/animation/interpolate.ts`)
        - Easing Functions (`src/animation/easing.ts`)
        - Script Importer (`src/importer/scriptImporter.ts`)
        - Scene Store (`src/store/sceneStore.ts`)
    - Added corresponding tests for all new components.

## Key Accomplishments
1.  **Project Initialization:** Successfully set up the monorepo structure, documentation, and tooling configuration.
2.  **Automation Framework:** Defined the "40 Daily Jules Agents" system in `AUTOMATION_PLAYBOOK.md` to guide future development.
3.  **Engine Core Implementation:** Delivered foundational engine components including:
    - Robust TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas.
    - Animation interpolation engine with comprehensive test coverage.
    - Scene state management using Zustand and Immer.
    - Script import validation logic.

## Blockers
- None currently. The environment is stable and tests are passing.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1.  **Continue Phase 1 Execution:**
    - Implement `LightRenderer` and `CameraRenderer` components.
    - Develop the `SceneManager` to orchestrate rendering based on the store state.
2.  **Verify Rendering Pipeline:** Ensure the new renderers integrate correctly with `SceneManager`.
