# Animatica Nightly Status Report - 2026-02-28

## Project Overview
- **Project Health Score:** 6/10
- **Status:** Phase 2 (Characters) & Phase 3 (Editor UI) in progress.

## Quality Metrics
- **Tests Passing:** 170
- **Tests Failing:** 5
- **Total Tests:** 175
- **Regressions Found:**
  - `CharacterRenderer.test.tsx`: Fails due to component implementation missing `React.memo` and `React.forwardRef` wrappers expected by the test strategy.
  - `Viewport.test.tsx`: Fails due to incorrect lowercase imports of `@animatica/engine` instead of `@Animatica/engine`.
  - `benchmark.test.ts`: `Store Actor CRUD Throughput` fails due to exceeding the default 5s timeout.

## Issue Tracking
- **Open Issues:** 5 (approximate)
- **Closed Issues Today:** 1 (Web3 Audit)
- **Total Tasks Remaining:** Phase 2 (~3 tasks), Phase 3 (~1 task), Documentation Sync.

## Activity Summary (Today)
- **Commits Today:** 2
- **Files Changed:**
  - `packages/engine/src/__tests__/benchmark.test.ts`
  - `reports/baseline_metrics.json`
  - `docs/WEB3_READINESS.md`

## Key Accomplishments
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Added a comprehensive benchmark suite to track interpolation speed, schema validation, and store throughput.
- **Web3 Readiness Audit:** Completed the audit of blockchain-related hallucinations. `docs/WEB3_READINESS.md` created, confirming the project's non-readiness and prohibited status for Web3 features.
- **Documentation Deep Dive:** Completed a full review of the 30+ documentation files to ensure alignment between automation rules and current project state.

## Blockers Found
- **Component Implementation Mismatch:** `CharacterRenderer.tsx` was implemented without the `memo` and `forwardRef` wrappers that its corresponding test file uses to inspect the JSX.
- **Import Casing Inconsistency:** Multiple files in `packages/editor` use lowercase `@animatica/engine` imports, causing resolution failures in some test environments that strictly enforce case sensitivity.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1. **Fix CharacterRenderer:** Wrap the `CharacterRenderer` component in `React.memo` and `React.forwardRef` to fix the unit tests.
2. **Standardize Import Casing:** Update all editor package imports to use the correct `@Animatica/engine` casing.
3. **Optimize Benchmarks:** Increase the timeout for long-running CRUD benchmarks to 30s to prevent intermittent failures.
4. **Sync BACKLOG.md:** Move completed Phase 1 tasks (7-10) to the "Done" section to reduce documentation drift.
