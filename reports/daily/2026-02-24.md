# Nightly Status Report: 2026-02-24

## Project Health Score: 9/10
The project is in excellent health. All 156 tests are passing across the monorepo. Today's major update integrated the `SpeakerRenderer` and strengthened the `SceneManager` with comprehensive tests. The codebase is becoming increasingly robust, though some documentation alignment is still required.

## Tests
- **Passed:** 156
- **Failed:** 0
- **Total:** 156
- **Packages:**
    - `@Animatica/engine`: 129 tests passed (17 files)
    - `@Animatica/editor`: 26 tests passed (6 files)
    - `@Animatica/web`: 1 test passed (1 file)

## Issues
- **Open:** 9 (Tasks 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 in `docs/BACKLOG.md`)
- **Closed:** 6 (Tasks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 21)
- *Note:* Tasks 7, 8, 9, and 10 are functionally complete in the codebase but remain open in the backlog for final documentation synchronization.

## Commits Today
- **8517bf8** `Merge pull request #111 from Fredess74/feat/engine-scene-dev-speaker-renderer-7357637327019805159`
    - `feat(engine): add SpeakerRenderer and SceneManager tests`

## Files Changed
- **Total Files:** 139 (cumulative from today's merge)
- **Key Changes:**
    - Added `SpeakerRenderer` component to `packages/engine/src/scene/renderers/`.
    - Added extensive integration tests for `SceneManager`.
    - Refined `CharacterRenderer` and `LightRenderer` placeholders.
    - Updated infrastructure files including `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `supabase/migrations/`.

## Key Accomplishments
1.  **Audio Foundation:** Integrated the `SpeakerRenderer`, laying the groundwork for spatial audio.
2.  **Scene Manager Validation:** Added robust tests for the `SceneManager` to ensure correct actor dispatching and environment rendering.
3.  **Test Suite Expansion:** Increased the total test count to 156, maintaining a 100% pass rate.
4.  **Environment Stability:** Successfully restored the development environment and verified cross-package compatibility.

## Blockers Found
1.  **Documentation Desync:** `docs/BACKLOG.md` continues to track several completed tasks (7, 8, 9, 10) as "Backlog", which may cause confusion for incoming agents.
2.  **Schema Refactor (Task 2):** Moving Zod schemas to `src/importer/schemas/` is still pending, which is the final blocker for strict adherence to the project's folder structure for Phase 1.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1.  **Synchronize Backlog:** A Conductor or Progress Reporter agent should update `docs/BACKLOG.md` to move Tasks 7, 8, 9, and 10 to the "Done" section.
2.  **Execute Task 2 Refactor:** This should be prioritized to finalize the Engine Core's structural requirements.
3.  **Initiate Phase 2 (Characters):** Begin work on the `Humanoid` base component and ReadyPlayerMe integration.
