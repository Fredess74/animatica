# Nightly Status Report: 2026-02-24

## Project Health Score: 9/10
The project continues its rapid pace with the official completion of **Phase 3: Editor UI**. The documentation (`docs/PROGRESS.md`) has been synchronized with the codebase state, resolving the previous desync issue. Phase 2 (Characters) and Phase 4 (Export & Audio) are now active, with foundational components (`CharacterRenderer`, `scriptImporter`) already in place.

## Tests
- **Passed:** 129
- **Failed:** 0
- **Total:** 129
*(Based on last known state from 2026-02-23 report, assuming stability)*

## Issues
- **Resolved:** Documentation desync (Phase 3 completion acknowledged).
- **Active:**
    - Phase 2: Bone Controller, Morph Targets, Clothing System.
    - Phase 4: Video Exporter, Audio Engine.
    - Phase 5: AI Backend integration.

## Commits Today
- **[docs]** Updated `PROGRESS.md` to reflect Phase 3 completion and Phase 2/4 starts.
- **[engine]** (Previous day) `CharacterRenderer` and `SpeakerRenderer` integration.

## Files Changed
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`: Updated status tables and added detailed breakdowns for Phases 2, 3, and 4.
- `docs/AGENT_TASKS.md`: Cleaned up completed tasks.
- `docs/AGENT_COMPLETED.md`: Logged progress reporting.

## Key Accomplishments
1.  **Documentation Synchronization:** `docs/PROGRESS.md` now accurately reflects the codebase state.
2.  **Phase 3 Completion:** Editor Layout, Asset Library, Properties Panel, Timeline, Script Console, and Export Modal are all implemented and wired.
3.  **Phase 2 Initiation:** `CharacterRenderer` provides the rendering shell for characters.
4.  **Phase 4 Initiation:** `scriptImporter` (Task 21) provides the data ingestion layer.

## Blockers Found
- None currently. The path is clear for Character and Audio/Export development.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1.  **Prioritize Phase 2 (Characters):** Implement `BoneController.ts` and `MorphTargets.ts` to bring characters to life.
2.  **Advance Phase 4 (Audio):** Implement `AudioEngine.tsx` to support the `SpeakerRenderer`.
3.  **Expand Tests:** Ensure new Character components have robust unit tests.
