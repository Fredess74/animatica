# Nightly Report: 2026-02-24

**Date:** February 24, 2026
**Reporter:** Night Reporter

## 📊 Summary
- **Agents Active:** 8
- **Tasks Completed:** 9
- **Tasks Remaining:** 33 (approx)
- **Sprint Phase:** Phase 2 (Rendering) / Phase 4 (Editor UI) - **Note: Phase 4 work is proceeding ahead of Phase 2 completion.**

## 🟢 Completed Work (24 Hours)
The following tasks were completed by agents:

### Engine & Core
- **[engine-scene-dev]** Implemented `SpeakerRenderer` and `SceneManager` tests.
- **[engine-scene-dev]** Added `CharacterRenderer` placeholder structure.
- **[feature-flag-manager]** Created Feature Flag system in `packages/engine/src/config/featureFlags.ts`.
- **[type-auditor]** Conducted comprehensive Type Audit on `packages/engine`.
- **[perf-auditor]** Conducted Performance Audit (re-renders, bundle size).

### Editor UI
- **[editor-style-polisher]** Implemented CSS for Editor components matching design tokens.
- **[editor-test-writer]** Wrote tests for `AssetLibrary`, `PropertiesPanel`, and `TimelinePanel`.
- **[i18n-preparer]** Extracted hardcoded strings for internationalization.
- **[editor-properties-dev]** Wired `PropertiesPanel` to Zustand store (marked as 2025-02-23 in logs, corrected here).

## ⚠️ Observations & Issues
1.  **Sequence Deviation:** Significant work on the Editor UI (Batch 4) has been completed, while core Rendering components (Batch 2: LightRenderer, CameraRenderer, PlaybackController) remain pending. This creates a risk of integration debt.
2.  **Date Typo:** One task completion was logged with the year 2025.

## 📋 Recommendations for Tomorrow
1.  **Prioritize Batch 2:** The next Conductor should prioritize **Task 7 (Light Renderer)**, **Task 8 (Camera Renderer)**, and **Task 10 (Playback Controller)** to ensure the Engine foundation is solid before further UI work.
2.  **Verify Integration:** Ensure the newly wired `PropertiesPanel` correctly interacts with the Engine components as they are built.
3.  **Refactor:** Address the Zod schema location issue mentioned in the Sprint Status.

## 📈 Sprint Status
Updated `docs/SPRINT_STATUS.md` to reflect the progress in Phase 4 and the pending critical path in Phase 2.
