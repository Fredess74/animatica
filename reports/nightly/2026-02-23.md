# Nightly Report - 2026-02-23

## Executive Summary
Tonight's run was highly productive, with significant progress made on the Editor UI (Batch 4) and foundational improvements in the Engine (tests, types, feature flags). However, the team has deviated from the strict sequential plan outlined in `JULES_GUIDE.md`, completing Batch 4 tasks while critical Batch 2 (Rendering) components remain pending.

## Stats
- **Agents Ran:** 9 (inferred from completed tasks)
- **Tasks Completed:** 9
- **Errors/Conflicts:** None reported in logs, but sequence deviation noted.

## Completed Tasks (2026-02-23)
### Engine
- **[engine-scene-dev]** Add SpeakerRenderer and SceneManager tests (Batch 5/2 hybrid)
- **[feature-flag-manager]** Create feature flag system in packages/engine/src/config/featureFlags.ts
- **[engine-scene-dev]** Add CharacterRenderer placeholder to packages/engine/src/scene/renderers/
- **[type-auditor]** Scan all .ts files for any type, type assertions, missing return types in packages/engine
- **[perf-auditor]** Check for unnecessary re-renders, large bundle imports, missing memoization

### Editor (Batch 4 - Out of Sequence)
- **[editor-style-polisher]** Add CSS for editor components (panels, timeline, modals) matching design-tokens.css
- **[editor-test-writer]** Write tests for AssetLibrary, PropertiesPanel, TimelinePanel
- **[editor-properties-dev]** Wire PropertiesPanel to Zustand store (read/write actor properties)
- **[i18n-preparer]** Extract hardcoded strings to translation keys in editor package

## Blockers & Risks
1. **Sequence Deviation:** Batch 4 (Editor UI) is proceeding ahead of Batch 2 (Rendering). This creates a risk where the Editor UI components are ready but have no underlying 3D scene to manipulate (missing Light/Camera renderers).
2. **Missing Core Components:** Tasks 7 (Light Renderer) and 8 (Camera Renderer) are still pending.

## Recommendations for Tomorrow (Conductor)
1. **Enforce Batch 2 Completion:** Prioritize `[ROLE: engine-scene-dev]` to complete Task 7 (Light Renderer) and Task 8 (Camera Renderer).
2. **Pause Editor UI:** Temporarily halt new Editor UI features until the Rendering engine catches up.
3. **Refactor Schemas:** Address the Zod schema location mismatch noted in Sprint Status.
