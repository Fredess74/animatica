# Nightly Report: 2026-02-23

**Reporter:** Jules (night-reporter)
**Date:** 2026-02-23

## 📊 Summary
- **Agents Active:** 7 (based on completed tasks)
- **Tasks Completed:** 7
- **Tests:** 118 passed, 0 failed (in @Animatica/engine)
- **CI Status:** Green (Typecheck & Tests passing)

## 🏆 Completed Tasks
- [feature-flag-manager] Create feature flag system in packages/engine/src/config/featureFlags.ts
- [engine-scene-dev] Add CharacterRenderer placeholder to packages/engine/src/scene/renderers/
- [editor-style-polisher] Add CSS for editor components (panels, timeline, modals) matching design-tokens.css
- [editor-test-writer] Write tests for AssetLibrary, PropertiesPanel, TimelinePanel
- [i18n-preparer] Extract hardcoded strings to translation keys in editor package
- [type-auditor] Scan all .ts files for any type, type assertions, missing return types in packages/engine
- [perf-auditor] Check for unnecessary re-renders, large bundle imports, missing memoization

## 🧪 Health Check
- **Typecheck:** Passed (All packages)
- **Unit Tests:** Passed (118 tests in @Animatica/engine)
- **Coverage:** Good progress on engine core.

## ⚠️ Observations & Issues
- `zustand` persist middleware warnings observed during tests (storage unavailable). This is expected in JSDOM but could be mocked to reduce noise.
- `turbo` command was missing from path initially, required `pnpm install`.
- "Sequence Deviation" noted in SPRINT_STATUS.md (Task 21 implemented early).

## 📝 Recommendations for Tomorrow
1.  **Prioritize Rendering:** Focus on `LightRenderer`, `CameraRenderer`, and `SceneManager` to complete Batch 2.
2.  **Refactor Schemas:** Address the schema location discrepancy (Task 2).
3.  **Mock Storage:** Add storage mocking to tests to silence zustand warnings.
