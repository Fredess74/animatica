# Product Vision

## Philosophy

People write fanfiction even though they don't read books. The same revolution is coming to video. Millions of people have stories in their heads — characters, worlds, dramas — but zero tools to bring them to life. Professional animation requires years of training and expensive software.

**Animatica exists to close this gap.**

We help people take their creative vision from idea to finished animated film — with AI assistance, intuitive game-like tools, and a platform where every creator can earn money regardless of where they live.

## Core Principles

1. **Everyone is a director** — No skill barrier. Text in → animation out.
2. **Creation is a game** — The process must be fun, beautiful, and rewarding.
3. **Finish what you start** — AI helps you push through the "messy middle" to a polished result.
4. **Global by default** — Crypto enables borderless payments. Any language. Any country.
5. **Community is currency** — Viewers fund creators. Creators fund each other.

## Target Audience — The "Desperately Creative"

Our first users are people with overflowing imagination and zero production tools:

| Segment | Size | Pain Point | What They Do Now |
|---------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Fanfic writers** | ~50M+ | Can't visualize their stories | Write text on Wattpad/AO3 |
| **Roleplay communities** | ~20M+ | No way to record/share RP sessions | Text RP on Discord/forums |
| **TikTok/YouTube creators** | ~100M+ | Animation is too hard/expensive | Use meme templates, slideshows |
| **Aspiring filmmakers** | ~10M+ | Can't afford Blender/Maya learning curve | Stuck in "idea" phase |
| **Anime/manga fans** | ~50M+ | Want to create, not just consume | Draw fan art instead |
| **Game modders** | ~15M+ | Machinima tools are dead | Record in-game clips |

**Psychographic profile:** Creative, digitally native (16-35), comfortable with games and social media, frustrated by the gap between imagination and execution. They value self-expression over technical perfection.

## Kano Model Analysis

### Must-Have (Basic Expectations)

Users won't even try the product without these:

- Text → 3D scene generation (core promise)
- Intuitive editor (drag-and-drop, no code)
- Video export (MP4, Full HD+)
- Free to start (no paywall for creating)
- Multi-language UI

### Performance (Satisfaction Scales Linearly)

More = better, directly proportional to satisfaction:

- Number of animation styles (PBR, cartoon, pixel art, anime)
- Character customization depth (clothing, expressions, body types)
- Asset library size (environments, props, characters)
- Export quality (1080p → 4K)
- Timeline length (short clips → full films)
- AI accuracy (how well text matches the generated scene)

### Delighters (Unexpected Joy)

These create "wow" moments and viral sharing:

- Real-time collaboration (create together like a game)
- Earn money from day one (donation pool)
- AI that suggests camera angles, music, pacing
- Asset marketplace (your prop earns you royalties)
- Game-like creation process (achievements, milestones)
- Style transfer between 2D ↔ 3D
- One-click genre presets (noir, comedy, horror, anime)

### Indifferent

Users don't care about:

- Blockchain technology details (just "it works")
- Code-level customization
- Enterprise features
- Desktop app (web is enough)

### Reverse (Would Hurt if Present)

Features that would drive users away:

- Complex UI requiring tutorials
- Mandatory crypto wallet for viewing
- Watermarks on free tier
- Content restrictions on fanfic/parody
