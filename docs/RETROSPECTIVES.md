# Daily Retrospectives

## 2026-02-22

- **What went well:** Core renderers (`Primitive`, `Light`, `Camera`) implemented and merged.
- **What to improve:** Documentation (`PROGRESS.md`) lags behind code changes; renderers are marked pending but exist.
- **Commit Summary:** `feat/engine-renderers` (PR #54).
- **Suggestions for tomorrow:** Implement `SceneManager` and `PlaybackController` to close Phase 1. Sync docs.
