# Bundle Analysis Report (Cancelled)

**Date:** 2024-05-22
**Agent:** BUNDLE WATCHER
**Status:** CANCELLED / OBSOLETE

## Note
This task was cancelled as the code changes were already partially implemented in main via previous merges, leading to conflicts.

Original intent was to optimize `three` imports in `@Animatica/engine`.
