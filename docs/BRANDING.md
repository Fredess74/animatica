- **Domain available** (.com or .io)
- **No negative connotations** in major languages
- **Evocative** of creation, movement, cinema, or magic

## Name Proposals

| Name | Vibe | Rationale | Domain Check |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Frameo** | Cinema + creative | "Frame" (cinema) + "o" (friendly suffix) | frameo.io |
| **Motionix** | Tech + animation | Motion + suffix (like Pixar-ish) | motionix.com |
| **Scenius** | Genius + community | Brian Eno's concept of "scene genius" — collective creativity | scenius.io |
| **Kinemo** | Cinema + movement | Kino (cinema) + emo (emotion/movement) | kinemo.io |
| **Plotline** | Storytelling | Direct reference to narrative structure | plotline.studio |
| **Castify** | Cast + create | "Cast" as in casting actors + broadcast | castify.io |
| **Reelcraft** | Cinema + craft | "Reel" (film) + "craft" (making) | reelcraft.io |
| **Animatica** | Animation + magic | Sounds premium, cinema-related (animatic = pre-vis) | animatica.io |
| **Storyweave** | Narrative fabric | Stories woven together, community creation | storyweave.io |
| **Renderscape** | Visual + world | Render + landscape — building visual worlds | renderscape.io |

### Top 3 Recommendation

1. **Scenius** — Unique, cerebral, community-focused. Brian Eno coined it to describe the intelligence of a creative community. Perfect for a platform where everyone creates together.

2. **Kinemo** — Short, punchy, global. Works phonetically in every major language. Kino is universal for cinema.

3. **Animatica** — Descriptive but premium. Immediately says "animation" while sounding sophisticated. An "animatic" is an industry term for animated storyboards — exactly what the AI generates.
